# Deriving FI in UKBB

## Background

We first want to derive the FI in UKBB - to do this we follow the method of Williams et al. 2019, whose repository was originally forked, but the method shall be recapitulated in R.

The Stata .do file is in `/Stata`

## Original info from forked repo (https://github.com/dylwil/ukbfrailty)
Stata .do file outlining the calculation of a frailty index for ~502,000 UK Biobank participants based on 49 items from baseline assessment data
